## Class notes
### Bioinformatics & Genetics
1. Gene: Coding & Noncoding
  - Gene is a piece of information.
  - Amoeba has one of the largest genome size.
  - Protein-sequencing regions only occupy a small fraction of human genome, human genome has the most non-coding regions fraction.
  - Scientists has chronologically discovered mRNA, catalytic RNA, miRNA, lincRNA and so on.
2. Method: Sequencing & Computing
  - Sequencing cost has decreased enormously during the past few decades
  - Nanopore and SMRT(Single Molecule Real-time) are the two representative $3_{rd}$ generation sequencing methods
  - Bioinformatics data is big and high-dimensional, such as TCGA
3. Example Studies
  - RNG (Robot, Nanotech and Genetics) are key points of sigularity where artificial intelligence (AI) can surpasses human intelligence

### Algorithm and Model
| Algorithm | Model |
| :---: | :---: |
| Step-by-step problem-solving procedure | Simplified complex system or process |
| eg. computational algorithm | eg. mathematical and probability algorithm |

- An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing a specific task. It is a set of instructions or rules that must be followed in order to achieve a certain goal.

- A model is a simplified representation of a complex system or process. It is a conceptual framework that helps us understand how something works or how different variables interact with each other. Models can be used to make predictions, test hypotheses, or simulate real-world scenarios.

In essence, an algorithm is a specific set of instructions for solving a problem, while a model is a more general conceptual framework for understanding a system or process.
